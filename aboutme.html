    <h3>
        Hello everyone my name is James Togher an I'm a Computer Science student.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Programming in C++ is one of my favorite hobbies because it challenges me to think critically and solve complex problems. I enjoy building efficient and scalable solutions, whether it's designing algorithms, creating games, or working on other fun projects. Outside of programming, I stay active by working out. I also enjoy cooking, trying and enjoying different foods. All together, I feel these hobbies keep me balanced, and gerneally pretty happy.
